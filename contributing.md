## Contribution Process

* Before making a contribution, please contact the project owner via issue or email. 
We aim for a short exchange on your contribution-ideas to streamline the subsequent

your contribution. If you contacted the project maintainer via issue, 
please reference the issue when submitting your pull request.

your contribution with appropriate tests. Furthermore, please ensure,
that the existing tests remain successful.
